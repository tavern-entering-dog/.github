We are a small indie studio based in the **Canary Islands**, Spain. We aim to create **short yet delightful experiences** that convey ideas or explore mechanics rarely pondered before.
> Reality is broken. Game designers can fix it.

#### Our team

#### Open Source initiative
We are utterly devoted to the Open Source movement, and thus we try to make most of our projects' code available for everyone, so you know what's going on behind the scenes. Stay tuned for more information on our new games and code releases.

#### A little joke
> A dog walked into a tavern and said, "I can't see a thing. I'll open this one."

That's where our name comes from! If you didn't find it funny don't worry, we didn't either.
