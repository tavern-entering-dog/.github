<p>We are a small indie studio based on the <strong>Canary Islands</strong>, in Spain. Our goal is to create <strong>short yet delightful experiences</strong> that convey ideas or explore mechanics&nbsp;rarely pondered&nbsp;before.</p>

<h4>Our Team</h4>
<ul><li><strong>Henry D.B.&nbsp;</strong>Lead coder and designer.</li></ul>
<h4>Open Source Initiative</h4>
<p>We are utterly devoted to the Open Source movement, and thus we try to make most of our projects' code available for everyone, so you know what's going on behind the scenes. Stay tuned to for more information on our new games and code releases.</p>
